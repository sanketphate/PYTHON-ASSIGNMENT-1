        "Python has become one of the most widely used programming languages due to its simplicity, versatility, and powerful capabilities. Here are the key features that make it popular\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Simple and Easy to Learn:\n",
        "Python has a clean and readable syntax similar to English, making it easy for beginners to learn and use.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Interpreted Language:\n",
